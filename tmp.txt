*Comparable week basis: Fiscal 2017 was a 53-week year, resulting in a one-week calendar shift in fiscal year 2018. During the second quarter of
2018, this calendar shift had a favorable impact on total revenue of 
$5.7 million
, EBITDA of 
$3.7 million
, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 million
 due to
seasonality (one extra higher-volume Òsummer weekÓ this year versus last year).
**2017 litigation settlement expense: During the second quarter 2017, we recorded a 
$2.6 million
 litigation settlement expense within general and
administrative expenses (
$1.6 million
 net of taxes or 
$0.04
 per diluted share).
ÒWe delivered meaningful sequential improvement in comparable store sales and double-digit revenue growth during the second quarter. We are
pleased with the strong guest response to our proprietary VR platform and look forward to building on this momentum. Our team is laser-focused on
executing on our key strategic priorities to drive further improvement in performance. Meanwhile, our new stores are tracking well and we remain
well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term opportunity to more than double our store base in the US and Canada,Ó said

Executive Officer.
